			<h3> 
				Some may notice the large gap between business ownerships in America. Some may say that this gap is at record lows and will continue to decrease. That minorities own a large portion or the firms in America and that the gender gap is mostly apparent in the gender pay gap and business ownership does not apply. In 2012, just a few years ago, this did not hold true. According to the United States Bureau of the Census, there is a large gap between the percentage of men, women, minorities and non-minorities who own businesses in the United States. In 2012 the United States had nearly 28 million companies or firms. Surveys showed that 54% were owned primarily by men, 36% by women, 29% by minorities, and 69% by non minorities. These large gaps in who owns American businesses can bring up the question of who owns and runs America.
