				<h2> A brief look into what who owns businesses in America as collected by the United States Bureau of the Census.</h2>

			<h3> 
				According to the United States Bureau of the Census, there is a large gap between the percentage of men, women, minorities and non-minorities who own businesses in the United States. In 2012 the United States had nearly 28 million companies or firms. Surveys showed that 54% were owned primarily by men, 36% by women, 29% by minorities, and 69% by non minorities. 
			</h3>
			<h3>
				In this data set, are all nonfarm businesses filing Internal Revenue Service tax forms as individual proprietorships, partnerships, or any type of corporation that have paid employees or no paid employees, and with receipts of $1,000 or more. An owner is defined by possessing 51% or more of the firm. Percentages may not add up to 100% as some owners had the option of selecting more than one race as well as Hispanic firms had the option to be of any race. Also, the owner had the option to select an unidentified gender or equally male/female.
